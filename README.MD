# Survivor Services

## Contains a Survivor API.
    * Has all the contestants names along with their age, season, living location and finish
    * Also has one for the season that shows the month and year that the season came out
    
## Problems
1) Got it to read the omdb information 
    * Problems arose from many naming errors
2) Whenever trying to change the bootstrap I would make my whole working service stop working.
    * Changed the coloring of the page and called it good to go. 
        * Will look further into css and styling at a later time
